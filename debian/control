Description: Protocol Buffers
 Protocol Buffers are Google's data interchange format.
 .
 This library contains the Ruby extension that implements Protocol Buffers
 functionality in Ruby.
 .
 The Ruby extension makes use of generated Ruby code that defines message and
 enum types in a Ruby DSL. You may write definitions in this DSL directly, but
 we recommend using protoc's Ruby generation support with .proto files. The
 build process in this directory only installs the extension; you need to
 install protoc as well to have Ruby code generation functionality.

Description: protocol buffers C++ library
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library needed for C++ applications.
